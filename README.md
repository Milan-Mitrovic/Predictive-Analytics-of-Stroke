# Predictive Analytics of Stroke
This project focuses on using supervised machine learning to predict stroke events. Given the critical nature of early detection and intervention for stroke patients, the goal is to identify individuals at risk and recommend the best-performing predictive model. The project evaluates five machine learning algorithms to determine the most effective approach for stroke prediction, providing insights into patient care, preventive measures, and data-driven healthcare strategies.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Explores health and demographic data to uncover stroke risk factors.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Evaluates multiple algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **SMOTEENN Oversampling:** Addresses severe class imbalance in the dataset for better model training.
- **Performance Metrics:** Assesses model accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC/AUC to ensure robust predictions.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains 5,110 paitent records and 12 features, including demographic information, health indicators, and lifestyle habits.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Key Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
